# Level II Events

A class in Level II is described by a number between 512-65535. Instead of writing a number the class can be described as CLASS2.XXXX indicate a specific (XXXX in this case) Level II class. Also the form CLASS2.XXXX=yy can be used where yy is the numerical form. 

Class definitions can be found in the header file **vscp_class.h** which is located located in the **src/vscp/common** folder. In the same folder **vscp_type.h** can be found which contains defines for types. Also the **vscphelper.h/cp**p files contains stuff that are useful for handling classes/types as a programmer.
