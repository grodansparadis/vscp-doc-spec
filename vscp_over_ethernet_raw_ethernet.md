# VSCP over Ethernet (raw Ethernet)

VSCP can use Ethernet directly making it possible to construct very low end nodes that use readily available Ethernet hardware. There is no need for nickname schema's etc as a VSCP GUID can be constructed from an Ethernet MAC. The payload is a standard VSCP level II frame with some specific Ethernet stuff in it- There are currently two types of frames

##  Version 1 frame (current) 

*This frame has been changed in format so it is consistent with the UDP and Multicast frames. Previous definition is below.*

##### Definition of type

 | ----    | -----------                  | 
 | 7,6,5,4 | Packet type. Currently zero. | 
 | 3,2,1,0 | Encryption.                  | 

##### Encryption types

 | Code | Description                                                  | 
 | ---- | -----------                                                  | 
 | 0    | No encryption                                                | 
 | 1    | AES128 CBC encryption. 16-byte IV is appended to each frame. | 
 | 2    | AES192 CBC encryption. 16-byte IV is appended to each frame. | 
 | 3    | AES256 CBC encryption. 16-byte IV is appended to each frame. | 
 | 4-15 | Reserved                                                     | 

For encryption/decryption code using OpenSSL see [this link](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/EVP_Authenticated_Encryption_and_Decryption). Note that byte 0 of the frame is never encrypted. The encryption/decryption is instead carried out over byte 1 to the CRC.

On the VSCP Server the md5 of the [vscptoken](https://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpd/doku.php?id=configuring_the_vscp_daemon#security) is used as the key for AES128.

Type in bold is usually what is seen on the software level.

The VSCP GUID for Ethernet is defined as

    FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FE:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:XX:XX

where **FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FE** say this is an Ethernet GUID and **YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY** is the MAC address and **XX:XX** is the ID for a specific VSCP device. Each node can thus appear as 65535 - 2 nodes which is perfect for a gateway or similar device that have VSCP devices connected on one or many other buses such as CAN, RF and the like. Two IDs are reserved. 0x0000 which is the Ethernet node itself and 0xFFFF which is all nodes on the interface. If a node consist just of itself then it can ignore the VSCP sub address but it is recommended that it use 0x0000 for its transmitted frames.

The header (32-bits) is defined as follows

 | Content                                      | Size    | Description                                                                  | 
 | -------                                      | ----    | -----------                                                                  | 
 | Priority (Bit 31,30,29)                      | 3 bits  | Standard VSCP priority.                                                      | 
 | Cryptographic algorithm (Bit 28, 27, 26, 25) | 4 bits  | Cryptographic algorithm used to encrypt payloads. This is yet to be defined. | 
 | Reserved                                     | 25 bits |                                                                              | 

Cryptographic encoding is done after type up to and including the last data byte thus the VSCP head is never encoded.

### Powering Ethernet nodes

The unused pairs can be used to power nodes and that way making them lower cost. In a perfect world a standard compliant Power over Ethernet schema could have been used. Regrettably the technique is to expensive. At least at the moment. Instead a +9-48V DC injector is used. If in doubt use +48V DC. The IEEE 802.3af standard POE pin out is as follows:

 | Pin | Description | 
 | --- | ----------- | 
 | 1   |             | 
 | 2   |             | 
 | 3   |             | 
 | 4   | +9V - +28V  | 
 | 5   | +9V - +28V  | 
 | 6   |             | 
 | 7   | GND         | 
 | 8   | GND         | 

Maximum power usage depends on the cabling but for AWG-24 it is 0.5A for each pair but never more then 13 watts. There is a description of how different manufacturers implement this here [https://pinouts.ru/Net/poe_pinout.shtml]. A calculator for losses can be found here [https://www.demarctech.com/techsupport/poecalculate.htm||Power calculator].
